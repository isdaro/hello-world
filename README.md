# hello-world
following readme tutorial
I'm interestd in programming. I'm currently concentrating on learning the python programming/scripting language.
I took programming courses 30+ years ago, but never really had a programming job. I maintained my programming skills mainly by doing MS vba macros in MS Excel.
